      <hr />
      <p>
        Lake <span class="lake">Urmia</span> (also Orumiyeh or Orumieh) is an
        endorheic salt lake in Iran.The lake is located between the provinces of
        <em>East Azerbaijan</em> and <em>West Azerbaijan</em> in Iran, and west
        of the southern portion of the Caspian Sea. At its greatest extent, it
        was the largest lake in the Middle East and the sixth-largest saltwater
        lake on Earth, with a surface area of approximately 5,200 km2 (2,000 sq
        mi), a length of 140 km (87 mi), a width of 55 km (34 mi), and a maximum
        depth of 16 m (52 ft).
        <br />
        Revered by ethnic Azeris as “the turquoise solitaire of Azerbaijan,”
        this lake has chipped away since the early 1970s, reducing its size by
        about 80 percent over the past 30 years. By late 2017, the lake had
        shrunk to 10% of its former size (and 1/60 of water volume in 1998) due
        to persistent general drought in Iran, but also the damming of the local
        rivers that flow into it, and the pumping of groundwater from the
        surrounding area.

        The images above show Lake <span class="lake">Urmia</span> on April 9,
        2018, and April 12, 2019. The images were acquired by the Moderate
        Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) on
        <strong>NASA’s Terra satellite</strong>. Officials report that the
        lake’s surface area reached roughly 3,000 square kilometers (1,200
        square miles) in April 2019.

        The flamingos that feasted on brine shrimp in this
        <strong>UNESCO</strong> biosphere reserve are mostly gone. So are the
        pelicans, the egrets, and the ducks. Even the tourists who flocked to
        Lake <span class="lake">Urmia</span> for therapeutic baths in its warm,
        hypersaline waters are staying away. What remain are piers that lead
        nowhere, the rusting carcasses of ships half-buried in the silt, and
        white, barren landscapes of exposed salt flats. Winds that whip across
        the lake bed blow salt dust to farm fields, slowly rendering the soil
        infertile. Noxious, salt-tinged dust storms inflame the eyes, skin, and
        lungs of people as far away as Tabriz, a city of more than 1.5 million
        about 60 miles away. And in recent years
        <span class="lake">Urmia</span>’s alluring turquoise waters were stained
        blood-red from algae and bacteria that flourish in these waters, which
        are eight times as salty as the ocean, and then turn color when sunlight
        penetrates the shallows.

        What’s happened to this cherished lake? Climate change has intensified
        droughts and elevated hot summer temperatures that speed up evaporation,
        scientists say. Yet that’s only part of the story: Engineers and water
        experts point out that the lake in this semiarid region is suffering
        from thousands of illegal wells and a proliferation of dams and
        irrigation projects that are diverting water from tributary rivers to
        grow apples, wheat, and sunflowers. The experts have called on Iran’s
        government to change course before
        <span class="lake">Urmia</span> “falls victim to the Aral Sea syndrome,”
        the overexploitation of water that doomed its sister inland sea in
        Central Asia.
